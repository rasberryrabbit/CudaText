Plugin for CudaText.
Adds support to call external apps in CudaText.
Adds menu "Tools" (near "Plugins") with commands: 
	Open config dialog, 
	Run tool1..toolN (after tools configured in dialogs).

Config file is settings/exttools.json.

Notes:
- "Shell command" option must be checked for tools which you want to run via OS-shell: 
	e.g. on Windows it's cmd.exe's commands. On Linux this opt usually not needed.
